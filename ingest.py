ingest.py — Data collection for unreal-sidekick skill (Step 1 of 2)

NO API CALLS. Collects everything and saves to disk for Claude Code extraction.

Pipeline — YouTube tutorial (Step 1 — this script):
  1. yt-dlp metadata + chapter parsing
  2. Whisper transcription (falls back to yt-dlp captions), per-sentence
     timestamps preserved even inside chapters
  3. Transcript segmented by chapters (or one "Full Content" section)
  4. Save raw .md to tutorials/<slug>.md (frame_status: pending-selection)
  5. Update INDEX.md with pending stub
  6. git commit + push

No video is downloaded and no frames are extracted here — frame timestamps
need judgment (which moment actually shows the technique), not a blind
percentage split, so that's deferred to select_frames.py (Step 2), run by
Claude Code after reading the timestamped transcript. See select_frames.py's
docstring for that step. Frames land in tutorials/frames/<slug>/ (local only,
not committed to git) once selected.

Pipeline — Epic documentation page (dev.epicgames.com/documentation):
  1. Detect hub page
  2. BFS crawl up to --doc-depth levels (default 2)
  3. Extract clean text per page
  4. Assemble into one structured .md file
  5. Update INDEX.md with pending stub
  6. git commit + push

Pipeline — Epic community page (dev.epicgames.com/community):
  1. Detect community URL → auto-resolve to YouTube via search
  2. Proceed as YouTube tutorial

#
# get_info() already calls --dump-json, so the video's own title, chapter titles
# and description are in hand before a single second of audio is decoded — and a
# tutorial description usually NAMES the exact nodes being demonstrated. Until
# 2026-09-03 none of it reached the decoder: initial_prompt was the static,
# skill-wide WHISPER_VOCAB_HINT and nothing else.
#
# This attacks the accent-substitution class AT THE SOURCE rather than detecting
# it afterwards: Whisper is far likelier to emit "Cull Volume" when that phrase
# is already in its prompt. (§3.2's wk8-05 case — "call the velocity" is really
# "cull" — is exactly this, and locally it took a frame to settle.)
#
# ⚠️ LANGUAGE GUARD, and it is not decoration. The single most expensive bug in
# this pipeline's history was a wrong-language initial_prompt: feeding an ENGLISH
# hint to a RUSSIAN decode triggered Whisper's multilingual-drift failure mode
# across five of nuke-em-all's Week 1 lessons (Spanish, Hangul and Chinese
# bleeding into the transcript). Metadata is attacker-adjacent in the same way —
# a Russian, Japanese or Arabic title appended to an English prompt is the same
# mistake arriving through a different door. Non-Latin-script candidates are
# therefore DROPPED, not transliterated.
#

# dump: past the window the decoder silently truncates, and what falls off the

# the project": when a span looks wrong, cutting it out and decoding it ALONE
# with the course prompt produces a genuinely independent second reading. Locally
# that was a manual step, done dozens of times across Weeks 7-8.
#
# The audio is ALREADY in the temp directory during a run, so this costs one
# extra short decode and stores nothing.
#
# ⚠️ DO NOT ARCHIVE AUDIO TO MAKE THIS EASIER. The plan declines that explicitly:
# archiving serves retroactive re-checking, which decision #1 has already ruled
# out, and it would accumulate junk for every span where nothing was said.
#
# ⚠️ ALWAYS OVERLAP KNOWN-GOOD TEXT ON BOTH SIDES -- "the agreement is what
# validates the splice" (§3.2). A slice whose overlaps do NOT agree with the full

# ── Source-max frame escalation (ULTIMATE_PIPELINE_PLAN.md §3.6) ──────────────
#
# ⚠️ This is the ANSWER TO OPEN QUESTION 5, and it is deliberately NOT a bulk
# reground. Measured 2026-09-03: 98.0% of houdini-wand's 3,205 frames, 98.6% of
# nuke-em-all's 590 and 100% of paint-me's 899 sit in the 720-1079 band, and
# NONE are >=1080 -- so "reground the corpus at 1080" would mean re-downloading
# ~590 tutorials, not a subset. Against that: the earlier campaign already took
# readability from 3.5% to 95%, nothing is illegible, and since Phase 0 new
# ingests already default to 1080 for the dense-UI skills, so the gap closes on
# its own going forward. Frames are also gitignored and device-local, so a bulk
# reground here would not help the other machine at all.
#
# The cost is therefore spent only where 720 vs 1080 can change an OUTCOME:
# §3.2's frame arbitration, where a frame is being used to decide a transcript
# word. wk8-05's "call the velocity" is really "cull", and only the `Cull Volume`
# parameter visible in frame settled it. That is the case worth a fresh grab.
#

# with `--force-keyframes-at-cuts` works against these sources -- a 10s section
# fetched in 2.4s. But the FIRST verification came back 640x360, because the

    ingested libraries: unreal-sidekick's frames are 256x144 (avg 11KB) and
    nuke-em-all's are 256x144/426x240, resolutions at which node names and
    parameter values in a screencast are simply not legible. Frame grounding
    cannot work when the frame cannot be read, so the whole point of Step 2 was
    being lost.

    Capped at 720p rather than uncapped: frames are only sampled at a handful of
    timestamps, but yt-dlp still downloads the whole file, and these run in
    batches of hundreds. Set INGEST_FRAME_HEIGHT to raise it (1080 helps for

    PLAYER CLIENT (added 2026-08-24, plan batch D1). The height cap above is
    only reachable if the player client actually exposes the adaptive ladder.
    The `android` client that four of the five skills force in _ytdlp_cmd()
    exposes ONE muxed stream -- itag 18, 640x360 -- so `bestvideo[height<=720]`
    has nothing to match and selection falls all the way through to that 360p
    stream. Measured on O6T5eVYJHsA: android offers 640x360 and nothing else;
    web_embedded offers the full ladder up to 1920x1080. This silently undid
    D0b for four of the five skills: D1's first run re-captured 119 tutorials
    and got 640x360 (360x360 for vertical shorts) -- better than 256x144, but
    not the 720p D0b was written to deliver, and not enough for a Houdini
    parameter pane.

    So the FRAME download asks for web_embedded first and falls back to
    whatever _ytdlp_cmd() chose if that fails. Audio (Step 1) is deliberately
    left alone: it re-encodes to mp3 and does not care about resolution, and
    android is the client that survives YouTube's bot check -- which is what
    E3b decided and this does not reopen. The cookies path already exposes the
    full ladder, so it is passed through untouched.

# §3.7 item 4 -- spend the frame budget where the transcript is UNCERTAIN.
#
# ⚠️ The plan's wording for this item is STALE, written against an older
# pipeline: "capture extra frames at flagged timestamps, IN THE SAME RUN while
# the video is still in the temp directory". ingest.py no longer downloads video
# at all -- frame capture moved to Step 2 (select_frames.py) so a human or model
# picks content-anchored moments instead of the script guessing. There is no
# video in temp to spend frames from.
#
# So the item is implemented as a HANDOFF rather than a capture: Step 1 records
# the timestamps its detectors distrust, and Step 2 spends frames there via
# `select_frames.py <slug> --from-flags`. Same intent -- aim the budget at
# uncertainty -- adapted to where the video actually lives now.
#
# ⚠️ These are the CROSS-CHECK's spans. They say "the two ASRs disagree here",
# never "this is what matters in the video". Richness-directed selection (§3.8)
# is a different signal and does not come from this field.

    """Fetch a web article or documentation page as plain text.

    Vendor documentation (D4b) is why this is more than a tag-strip. Foundry's
    Katana docs are MadCap Flare pages: ~220KB of HTML where the real article
    lives in a div#mc-main-content, wrapped in five <nav> blocks, a footer and a
    cookie widget. Stripping tags off the whole page and keeping the first 8000
    characters spent part of the budget on "Skip To Main Content / Account
    Settings / Search Tips" and then truncated the GafferThree page mid-sentence
    at roughly a quarter of its content (29,449 clean chars measured).

    So: drop chrome elements, prefer a main-content container when the page
    declares one, and only then strip tags. The cap is raised because a doc page
    is legitimately longer than a blog post and much shorter than a transcript.
