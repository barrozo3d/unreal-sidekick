validate.py — Post-ingest integrity checker for unreal-sidekick tutorials.

Run from the repo root:
    python validate.py

Exit 0 = all checks pass.
Exit 1 = one or more failures found (details printed to stdout).

Checks performed:
  1. No [PENDING EXTRACTION] markers in any tutorial body
  2. No extraction_status: pending in frontmatter
  3. No ue_version: "[PENDING]" in frontmatter
  4. No empty tags arrays (tags: [] or tags: [""])
  5. INDEX.md has no duplicate **File:** entries
  6. Every tutorial file on disk appears in INDEX.md exactly once
  7. Every INDEX.md file reference points to a file that exists on disk
  8. Every tutorial with a YouTube source has non-trivial structured notes (> 200 chars)
  9. YouTube videos with duration > 3 min have a non-empty transcript
     (catches failed/truncated ingest where yt-dlp or Whisper returned nothing)
  10. No PLACEHOLDER url: values in frontmatter
  11. No un-triaged promotional / no-content entries (scan_promo.py, allowlisted)
  12. INDEX block integrity — no block describing a different tutorial, no
      leftover [PENDING] fields, no mojibake

        markers inside tutorial FILES, so an unextracted index entry -- the
        actual retrieval surface -- passed silently.

    Scoring lives in scan_promo.py and is imported, never duplicated: the

    of the rules would drift from it silently.

    Fails ONLY on a candidate that is not in scan_promo.ALLOWLIST. That split
    is the whole design:

      - A candidate requires a SELF-DECLARED signal -- the extraction's own
        prose calling the entry a trailer, an ad, a course announcement.
        Structural signals (short video, thin Key Steps, few named nodes)
        corroborate but never accuse on their own, because that shape is also
        a perfectly good short-form feature tutorial, which is how most plugin
        and add-on documentation is published. Getting this wrong once meant
        flagging a 1-minute tutorial with five concrete steps as an ad.

      - ALLOWLIST is a decision record, not a mute button. Every entry carries
        a written reason (deliberate paywalled gap-filler, series intro chapter
        whose siblings are real, demoted course overview, triaged false
        positive). Adding an entry means recording a decision, and that is the
        intended way to clear this check -- not loosening the scorer.

    A new promo entry therefore fails the build; an already-triaged one does
    not. That is exactly what was missing when tutorials/noise.md sat at the
