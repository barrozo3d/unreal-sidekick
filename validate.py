validate.py — Post-ingest integrity checker for unreal-sidekick tutorials.

Run from the repo root:
    python validate.py

Exit 0 = all checks pass.
Exit 1 = one or more failures found (details printed to stdout).

Checks performed:
  1. No [PENDING EXTRACTION] markers in any tutorial body
  2. No extraction_status: pending in frontmatter
  3. No ue_version: "[PENDING]" in frontmatter
  4. No empty tags arrays (tags: [] or tags: [""])
  5. INDEX.md has no duplicate **File:** entries
  6. Every tutorial file on disk appears in INDEX.md exactly once
  7. Every INDEX.md file reference points to a file that exists on disk
  8. Every tutorial with a YouTube source has non-trivial structured notes (> 200 chars)
  9. YouTube videos with duration > 3 min have a non-empty transcript
     (catches failed/truncated ingest where yt-dlp or Whisper returned nothing)
  10. No PLACEHOLDER url: values in frontmatter
  11. No un-triaged promotional / no-content entries (scan_promo.py, allowlisted)
  12. INDEX block integrity — no block describing a different tutorial, no
      leftover [PENDING] fields, no mojibake

    Fails ONLY on a candidate that is not in scan_promo.ALLOWLIST. That split
    is the whole design:

      - A candidate requires a SELF-DECLARED signal -- the extraction's own
        prose calling the entry a trailer, an ad, a course announcement.
        Structural signals (short video, thin Key Steps, few named nodes)
        corroborate but never accuse on their own, because that shape is also
        a perfectly good short-form feature tutorial, which is how most plugin
        and add-on documentation is published. Getting this wrong once meant
        flagging a 1-minute tutorial with five concrete steps as an ad.

      - ALLOWLIST is a decision record, not a mute button. Every entry carries
        a written reason (deliberate paywalled gap-filler, series intro chapter
        whose siblings are real, demoted course overview, triaged false
        positive). Adding an entry means recording a decision, and that is the
        intended way to clear this check -- not loosening the scorer.

    not. That is exactly what was missing when tutorials/noise.md sat at the

def check_cross_links():
    """Check #14 -- tutorial cross-links point at files that exist.

    Nothing has ever validated these. A1 found 9 inbound links to a file that was
    about to be deleted and validate.py would have passed with all 9 dangling
    (finding #8); A7 was the slot for this check and shipped the promo gate
    instead. When it was finally measured (E5) there were 7 broken links -- none
    from the A6 removals, which came out clean, but hand-written links whose slug
    never matched a file ("a - b" slugified to "a---b" where ingest.py writes
    "a-b"). Cheap to break, invisible without a check.

    WIDENED 2026-08-31. The v1 regex matched `[Text](file.md)` only, and the
    corpus writes links three ways -- so it saw 1,378 links and was blind to
    1,217 more (47%). unreal-sidekick writes `## Related Entries` with `[[slug]]`
    wiki-links in 352 of its 353 files, so its ENTIRE cross-link graph was
    unvalidated. Seven genuinely broken links were hiding there, and every one of
    them is an inbound link to a file A6 deleted -- exactly the failure mode
    finding #8 named and this check was built to stop. It did not stop it,
    because the removal happened in the one format the check could not read.

    The three forms, each matched against an observed convention:

        markdown  [Text](file.md)        whole file    the only form v1 saw
        wiki      [[slug]] / [[Title]]   whole file    unreal, houdini
        bullet    - Text (`file.md`)     Related only  nuke-em-all, paint-me, unreal

    Two scoping decisions worth keeping:

    * The backtick form is scoped to the Related section. Tutorial prose
      legitimately mentions `KNOWLEDGE_GAPS_TODO.md` and friends in backticks,
      and a whole-file scan reports those as broken links.
    * A wiki-link followed on the same line by a backticked filename resolves
      against THAT filename. houdini writes `[[Truncated Title]] (`real-slug.md`)`
      -- the wiki text is prose, the backtick is the target. Resolving the prose
      produced a false positive on the first pass.

    Wiki-links resolve by slug OR by title (frontmatter `title:`, else the H1),
    because the two skills using them chose different conventions: unreal writes
    slugs, houdini writes titles. Targets in `references/` resolve against the
    references directory -- a link to a reference file that does not exist is
    just as broken, and one such link was misreported as broken on an earlier
    pass precisely because references were not consulted.

    and never the filesystem, because frames are gitignored and DEVICE-LOCAL --
    a machine that never downloaded them is not evidence of absence. A purely
    filesystem check would be the first one whose result differs per machine,
    passing here and failing on the other device with neither being wrong.

    So:

      A) RECORD-ONLY, machine-independent -- `frame_count > 0` but the file cites
         no `frame_NNN.jpg` anywhere. The record contradicts itself identically on
         every machine, so this is the half that can legitimately gate.

      B) FILESYSTEM -- `tutorials/frames/<slug>/` holds images the .md never
         references. This is the true "orphan" D3 was named for, but it is
         device-local and must NEVER gate. Reported so the population stays
         visible, the same way check #1 prints transcript-less tutorials.
